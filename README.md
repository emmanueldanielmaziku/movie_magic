## Known Issues

### 1. **Dependency Issues**
   - **Issue**: Errors like `Could not resolve dependencies` or `Version solving failed` when running `flutter pub get`.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure your Flutter SDK is up to date by running:
       ```bash
       flutter upgrade
       ```
     - Delete the `pubspec.lock` file and run:
       ```bash
       flutter pub get
       ```
     - If the issue persists, check the versions of the dependencies in `pubspec.yaml` and ensure they are compatible with your Flutter SDK version.

### 2. **Firebase Configuration Errors**
   - **Issue**: Errors like `FirebaseApp not initialized` or `Missing GoogleService-Info.plist` when running the app.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure you have set up Firebase correctly for both Android and iOS:
       - Follow the [Firebase setup guide](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview) for Flutter.
       - Download the `google-services.json` file for Android and the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS from the Firebase Console.
       - Place these files in the correct directories:
         - Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
         - iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
     - Rebuild the app after adding the configuration files.

---

### 3. **Hive Initialization Errors**
   - **Issue**: Errors like `Hive not initialized` or `TypeAdapter not found`.
   - **Solution**:
     - Ensure you have initialized Hive in your app:
       ```dart
       await Hive.initFlutter();
       ```
     - If using Hive with TypeAdapters, ensure you have run the code generator:
       ```bash
       flutter pub run build_runner build
       ```
     - Register your adapters before using them:
       ```dart
       Hive.registerAdapter(YourAdapter());
       ```
